- [Microsoft Windows](#microsoft-windows)
- [Linux](#linux)
    - [Ubuntu](#ubuntu)
    - [OpenSUSE](#opensuse)
    - [Arch Linux](#arch-linux)

## Overview

While GROOPS is intended to be a standalone software package, some functionality depends on external libraries.
The installation instructions provided further below include steps to install these dependencies.
Hard dependencies are:

 - [the Expat XML parser](https://libexpat.github.io)
 - an implementation of the Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK), for example:
    - [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS)
    - [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/math-kernel-library.html)

Additional libraries extend the feature set of GROOPS and can be optionally enabled at compile time.
At the moment, these include:

- [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf) for reading and writing NetCDF files
- [zlib](https://zlib.net) for reading and writing compressed files
- the Essential Routines for Fundamental Astronomy ([liberfa](https://github.com/liberfa/erfa)) for high-precision
  Earth rotation

Another optional dependency is an implementation of the Message Passing Interface standard (MPI,
for example [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/) or [Microsoft MPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/message-passing-interface/microsoft-mpi)).
Resource intensive tasks and algorithms are designed and implemented to be optionally run in
parallel on distributed systems.

To visualize data sets, GROOPS requires an installation of the [Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)](https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/).

## Get the GROOPS Source Code

You can download the source code of a specific version on the
[Releases](https://github.com/groops-devs/groops/releases) page, or
clone the repository to always get the latest updates:

```
git clone https://github.com/groops-devs/groops.git
```

## Microsoft Windows

GROOPS under Windows requires CMake, and 64bit C++14 and Fortan compilers.
A convenient way to install all required tools is through [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org).
This installation guide assumes that the GROOPS source code is located in `C:\groops`.

1. Download the MSYS2 installer and follow the [installation guide](https://www.msys2.org/#installation).

2. **Important**: After successful installation, close the MSYS2 terminal from step 1 and open the **MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit terminal**
    through `Start Menu > MSYS2 64-bit > MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit`.

    The command prompt in the terminal window should now read `username@hostname MINGW64`.

3. Install compilers, cmake, expat, OpenBLAS, and LAPACK:
    ```
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake expat mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-openblas
    ```

4. *(Optional)* Install the NetCDF library:
    ```
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-netcdf
    ```

5. *(Optional)* Download and install liberfa:

    5.1. Install the `tar` utility and required build tool:
    ```
    pacman -S tar make
    ```

    5.2. Download and build the ERFA library:
    ```
    mkdir -p /c/groops/lib && cd /c/groops/lib
    wget https://github.com/liberfa/erfa/releases/download/v1.7.0/erfa-1.7.0.tar.gz
    tar -xvf erfa-1.7.0.tar.gz
    cd erfa-1.7.0
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    ```

6. *(Optional)* Install Microsoft MPI:

    6.1 Download and install the [Microsoft MPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/message-passing-interface/microsoft-mpi).

    6.2 Install the MSYS2 `msmpi` package:
    ```
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-msmpi
    ```

7. Create the build directory and compile GROOPS:
    ```
    mkdir /c/groops/source/build && cd /c/groops/source/build
    cmake.exe .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\groops"
    mingw32-make.exe -j4
    mingw32-make.exe install
    ```

8. Make sure to also read the [post-installation steps](#windows-post-installation-steps).

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The GROOPS GUI is based on [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and is tested with Qt version 5.15.1.

We recommend installing the GROOPS GUI via the precompiled Windows binaries provided with
each [release](https://github.com/groops-devs/groops/releases).

In case you want to compile the GUI yourself, you need to:

1. [Download and install](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) Qt (registration required).

2. When prompted to choose which Qt components to install, select `Select Package Categories > LTS` and
   then select `Qt > Qt 5.15.1` or a newer version. Under `Developer and Designer Tools`, `Qt Creator Debugger Support`,
   `Debugging Tools for Windows`, `cmake`, and `Ninja` should be selected automatically.

3. Open the project file `C:\groops\gui\groopsGui.pro` in Qt Creator and build the project.

### Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)

The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) are an optional dependency of GROOPS and enable the generation of high-quality
figures.
GMT provides [Windows binaries](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/releases) which can be easily installed.
The current GROOPS release is tested against GMT version 6.4.0.

### Windows post-installation steps

After the installation of GROOPS and GROOPS GUI, we recommend some post-installation configuration steps to make
working with GROOPS easier.

1. To use the GROOPS and GROOPS GUI binaries without directory prefix, you have to add the required
   directories to the system path.

    1.1. Open the Control Panel through the Windows Start Menu: `Windows System > Control Panel`.

    1.2. In the Control Panel window, go to `User Accounts > User Accounts`.

    1.3. There you should click on `Change my environment variables`, which will open a new window.

    1.4. In the environment variable window, select `Path` and click `Edit...`. A pop-up window will appear
    where you can add the following directories to your system path:
    ```
    "C:\msys64\mingw64\bin"
    "C:\groops\bin"
    "C:\Program Files\Microsoft MPI\Bin"
    ```
    In case you manually compiled the GUI, additionally add the directory:
    ```
    "C:\Qt\5.15.1\mingw81_64\bin"
    ```
    The `mingw64` path should be in the first line of the list.

2. *(Optional)* Set the environment variable `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` or `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to the number of threads to use for matrix operations.

    :warning: When running GROOPS in parallel, threaded BLAS/LAPACK libraries may conflict with MPI processes and cause a deterioration of performance. In that case, the number of threads for matrix operations should be set to 1.

GROOPS depends on data files such as Earth rotation, Love numbers, and wavelet coefficients.
An initial data set that is regularly updated is available on [our FTP server](https://ftp.tugraz.at/outgoing/ITSG/groops/).
You can choose between downloading the data directory or a single [zip file](https://ftp.tugraz.at/outgoing/ITSG/groops/data.zip) with the same content.

## Linux

### Arch Linux

GROOPS is packaged for the [Arch User Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository).
You can install the [groops-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/groops-git/) package providing the core GROOPS executables,
and the [groopsgui-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/groopsgui-git/) package providing the GUI and documentation.

The easiest way to do this is through an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers). If you are using `yay`,
for example, you can install GROOPS and the GUI by executing:
```
yay -S groops-git groopsgui-git
```

If you want to develop for GROOPS, a manual installation is preferable.
This installation guide assumes that the GROOPS source code is located in `$HOME/groops`.

1. First, make sure your system is up to date:
    ```
    sudo pacman -Syu
    ```
2. Install dependencies and build tools:
    ```
    sudo pacman -S cmake gcc gcc-gfortran expat lapack zlib
    ```
3. *(Optional)* Install the NetCDF development package:
    ```
    sudo pacman -S netcdf-cxx
    ```
4. *(Optional)* Install liberfa development packages. liberfa is available as an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/erfa/).

5. *(Optional)* Install an MPI development package, for example `openmpi`:
    ```
    sudo pacman -S openmpi
    ```
6. Create the build directory and compile GROOPS.
    ```
    mkdir $HOME/groops/source/build && cd $HOME/groops/source/build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/groops
    make -j4
    make install
    ```
7. Make sure to also read the [post-installation steps](#linux-post-installation-steps).

#### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The GROOPS GUI depends on Qt packages.
To install the required packages, run:
```
sudo pacman -S qt5-base
```
Then, change into the `gui` directory and compile the source code:
```
cd $HOME/groops/gui
qmake
make
```

#### Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)

The Generic Mapping Tools are available from the [Arch User Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository).
Install the [gmt](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/gmt/) and [gmt-coast](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gmt-coast) packages.

### Linux post-installation steps

After the installation of GROOPS and GROOPS GUI, we recommend some post-installation configuration steps to make
working with GROOPS easier.

1. To use the GROOPS and GROOPS GUI binaries without directory prefix, you have to add the required
   directories to the system path:

   ```
   echo "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/groops/bin" >> $HOME/.bashrc
   source $HOME/.bashrc
   ```

2. *(Optional)* Set the environment variable `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` or `OMP_NUM_THREADS`  to the number of threads to use for matrix operations.

    :warning: When running GROOPS in parallel, threaded BLAS/LAPACK libraries may conflict with MPI processes and cause a deterioration of performance. In that case, the number of threads for matrix operations should be set to 1.

GROOPS depends on data files such as Earth rotation, Love numbers, and wavelet coefficients.
An initial data set that is regularly updated is available on [our FTP server](https://ftp.tugraz.at/outgoing/ITSG/groops/).
You can choose between downloading the data directory or a single [zip file](https://ftp.tugraz.at/outgoing/ITSG/groops/data.zip) with the same content.

## Disabling external source files

While GROOPS is intended to be a standalone software package, some functionality depends on external software.
Information about external source code contained in the repository which is licensed differently can be found in the
[corresponding README](https://github.com/groops-devs/groops/blob/main/source/external/README.md).

To compile GROOPS without these external source files, variables can be passed to CMake in the configuration step,
for example:
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/groops -DDISABLE_IERS=TRUE
```
Available variables are ```DISABLE_HWM14```, ```DISABLE_NRLMSIS```, ```DISABLE_JB2008```,
```DISABLE_IGRF```, ```DISABLE_IERS```, ```DISABLE_ERFA```, ```DISABLE_Z```, and ```DISABLE_NETCDF```.
Setting these to ```TRUE``` will skip compilation of the respective source files.
